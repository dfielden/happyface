# site_emailer
Aim of project was to create a MVP website within a few days for the launch of an imaginary product.
Technology: Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite.
Website contained text and images about the imaginary product and was designed to be responsive to screen size.
Website also contained a 'Contact Us' form to let users enquire about the product by entering their name, email, message title and message.
After submitting the form, an email was sent to an email that had been set up for the imaginary business, letting the owner view these messages and reply if appropriate.
Messages were also stored in an SQLite database.
As part of the project, I registered the domain happyfacesteeringwheel.com and deployed the site to an Amazon EC2 instance, serving the website on the registered domain.
